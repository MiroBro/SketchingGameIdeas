I am a Unity Developer, and I am conceptualizing the following game ideas/mechanics and I would like your help with implementing each one as a minimum viable product. This folder has an empty Unity 2D project (Unity version 6000.3)

I will describe EACH game concept idea below, and I want you to implement each game concept in this unity project in individual scenes named appropriately. I want you to implement the full game loops. Please use placeholder art (simple shapes/sprites/meshes) to make each game.

Here are the games I need you to create inside this unity project. Please implement EACH.


MAKE THESE GAMES (SEPARATE THEM IN INDEPENDENT SCENES IN THE PROJECT):

GAME CONCEPT 1 - Garden Dortmantik
1 - Dortmantik is a game where you place tiles and get bonuses if you place them next to certain tiles, landing you bonuses etc.
2 - Please implement a SIMPLE dortmantik gameloop BUT it should be striktly garden related.
3 - I want to be able to test this simple dotmantik gameloop you've created inside a scene called "Garden Dortmantik"


GAME CONCEPT 2 - SPACE TOWER WIZARD
1 - Create a scene called "Space Tower Wizard" to make this other concept.
2 - This game is based on an idle game "Tower Wizard". In it you upgrade buildings and unlock new ones, slowly getting new resouces (please research it). Eventually you reach the sky by unlocking the tallest tower and you reach the sky finishing the game.
3 - In my case I want it SPACE themed, so you unlock buildings in space building out your space colony. The goal is to unlock a hyper space jump at which point you win the game.


GAME CONCEPT 3 - UNDERWATER KINGDOM CLONE
1 - This game is based on the popular games "Kingdom" (please research)
2 - In the kingdom games you walk left or right in a 2d world, interacting with resources to get coins. You can then use coins to build buildings, recruit simple people who farm/fight for you. Every night your little settlement gets attacked by demons running towards your settlement from the left or right. Your recruited people fight these off for you, but if they can't/are too weak the demons destroy your building and ultimately take your crown at which point you die.
3 - In my game I want these EXACT simplified mechanics BUT I want it underwater themed, and the player movement is done up and down (rather than left or right). Please do this, name the scene of this game "Underwater Kingdom"


GAME CONCEPT 4 - MAGIC BOOKS DIGSEUM
1 - There's a game called "Digseum", it's great. In it you dig out treasures (scene one) and put them in your museum (scene 2). You also upgrade your skills to get better at digging up treasures (in scene one, the treasures are hidden under a tilemap). The goal is to get many treasures making your museum awesome, so lots of small people visit (represented by simple sprites) and via an idle-mechanic give you money (letting you buy more upgrades).
2 - I want this game loop, BUT the theme should be Magic books. So you dig up magic books and them place these simply in your magic book shop increasing visitors (which gives you money). 
3 - Please implement this! 


GAME CONCEPT 5 - MAGIC CREATURE DIGSEUM
1 - This is like GAME CONCEPT 4, but mixed with a simple game called "Husbandry" (where you make unique animals). So instead of magic books one digs up unique magical animals. And in the second scene one can select 2 of the different magical animals one has uncovered, they will create a visual fusion (have visual qualities from each other, so a little like genetic mixing for a unique look, if a parent has a long neck and the other one is a ball, maybe they make a ball with a long neck baby). This offspring will then spawn in a zoo in a third scene, and this magical zoo people visit and give you money in an idle way. The more unique/strange mixes of animals/parts the more wizards visit and give you money.
2 - Please make this game, call it MagicCreatureDigseum


GAME CONCEPT 6 - LITTLE LIFE TRAIN
1 - There's a game called Little life (please look it up). It's a sims-like idle game where you create homes for 5-6 characters. You place furniture in their rooms. Each NPC (if I remember correctly), generates money for you idly. The better home they have to more they generate.
2 - I want to make a game like it, but instead of making a regular home this game is a train continously moving to the right. Everytime we add a person we add a train-cart for that person, and decorate their cart to fit them.  
3 - One wins when one has picked up 4 NPCs and made train carts and decorated each one simply for each NPC.
4 - Please create this, call this "LittleLifeTrain".

GAME CONCEPT 7 - PLANT HUSBANDRY
1 - There's a very simple, small, almost unknown game called "husbandry" (please look it up). In it you combine animals (like spiders and cats, or snakes and humans) creating hybrid alien animals. So a spider + cat would maybe yield offspring that looked like spiders but had a cute cat-face. One would then sell the animals for a profit, making one get more money. The more animals one had and the rarer the mixes, the more money one would also idle get. One could buy animal-types with money. 
2 - I want to make one like this but with PLANTS, so one can combine plants that look vastly different, and create offspring that are alien combinations that take an attribute from one parent and one from another to create novel plants. One then displays/sells them for money so one can buy more plants.
3 - Please creat this game and call it "PlantHusbandry"
